Best Practices:- 
  1. length should be atleat 12-16 charecters
  2. Complexity can be increased by using mixed word of charecters like Uppercase, Lowercase, Numbers and Symbols
  3. We should avoid use of common words and patters
  4.  Use passphrases i.e. combine random words or a sentence you can remember, example: BlueCar$Drives!Fast2025
  5. Avoid reusing passwords
  6. Avoid reusing passwords
  7. Never share your passwords

Tips learned from the evaluation :-
  1. Dont't use same type of charecters consecutevily. That is if possible avoid consecutive numbers or Uppercase
  2. Many users still choose weak or guessable passwords so don't use vewy obvious patters
  3. Short passwords are vulnerable to brute-force attacks
  4. Lack of special characters and case variety weakens security
  5. 2FA adoption is low but highly effective
  6. Changing passwords too frequently leads to bad habits

Common Passwords Attack :- 
  1. Brute Force Attack
    How it works: The attacker tries all possible combinations of characters until the correct password is found.
      Example: Trying aaaa, aaab, aaac, ..., up to zzzz.
      Defense:
          1. Use long and complex passwords
          2. Implement account lockouts after several failed attempts
          3. Use rate-limiting and 2FA
  2. Dictionary Attack
      How it works: The attacker uses a precompiled list of common passwords or words (like a dictionary) to guess the password.
        Example: Trying password, letmein, 123456, monkey, etc.
        Defense:
          1. Avoid common or dictionary-based passwords
          2. Use passphrases that combine unrelated words and symbols
  3. Credential Stuffing
      How it works: Attackers use leaked username-password pairs from data breaches to try and log in to other services.
        Example: If your email and password were leaked in a breach, attackers try the same pair on other sites.
        Defense:
          1. Do not reuse passwords across sites
          2. Use 2FA
          3. Monitor for data breaches using tools like HaveIBeenPwned
  4. Phishing
      How it works: Attackers trick users into revealing passwords via fake emails or websites.
        Example: A fake email from "your bank" asking you to log in.
        Defense:
          1. Be cautious with email links
          2. Verify URLs and senders
          3. Use browser warnings and email filters
  5. Keylogging
      How it works: Malicious software records everything you type, including passwords.
        Defense:
          1. Keep systems updated
          2. Use antivirus software
          3. Avoid downloading unknown files or apps
  6. Rainbow Table Attack
      How it works: Uses precomputed hash values to crack hashed passwords quickly.
        Defense:
          1. Use salting (adding random data before hashing passwords)
          2. Use strong hash functions (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2)
  7. Shoulder Surfing
      How it works: Physically observing someone typing their password.
        Defense:
          1. Be aware of surroundings
          2. Use privacy screens in public
          3. Use biometric login (fingerprint/face)

Summarize how password complexity affects security:-
  Password complexity greatly enhances security by making it harder for attackers to guess or crack a password through common attack methods like brute force and dictionary attacks.
  Use a password manager to generate and store complex, unique passwords for each account. Combine complexity with multi-factor authentication (MFA) for maximum security.
